# Pac-Men

## Description: 
This is a game of creating several PacMen with the click of a button. Placed in  random start positions, the simulation begins with the click of the 'Start Game'.This triggers the PacMen to move at random speed. Positions of each PacMan are tracked in the duration of the game, as to reverse direction when colliding with edge of the window.

## How to run: 
Three ways:<br>  
1) Clone the repository and run it on your local device.<br> 
2) Copy and paste link into browser: https://lei-marie.github.io/Pac-Men/<br> 
3) [Direct Link](https://lei-marie.github.io/Pac-Men/ "link title text")<br>

Begin simulation by clicking on the 'Add PacMan' button followed by the 'Start Game'. Restart by refressing the browser. 

## Future improvements:
Add more dynamic components to the page that increases the user interaction.
Add random color feature to each created PacMan
